# Union.ai Serverless Workshop

Welcome to the Union.ai Serverless Workshop! In this workshop, we will cover:

1. Setup workspace and connect to Union.ai Serverless
2. Launch a simple ML workflow & get familiar with the Python SDK
3. LLM tracking workflow using HuggingFace and Weights & Bias.
4. Explore models using Union hosted VSCode

## Setup Workspace

1. If you have not already, please sign up for Union Serverless at: https://signup.union.ai/
2. Sign into Weights and Bias: https://wandb.ai/
3. There are two options for configuring your workspace: GitHub Codespaces and Google Colab.
- If you went to use Google Colab, please go to [this link to open notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thomasjpfan/unionai-llm-tracking-workshop/blob/main/workshop.ipynb). If you are already in Colab, you can continue to the next steps.
- If you want to use GitHub codespaces, please see [the README.md](https://github.com/thomasjpfan/unionai-llm-tracking-workshop?tab=readme-ov-file#unionai-serverless-workshop) for details.

```{python}
try:
    import google.colab
    IN_COLAB = True
except ImportError:
    IN_COLAB = False

if IN_COLAB:
    !git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/thomasjpfan/unionai-llm-tracking-workshop.git
    %cd unionai-llm-tracking-workshop
    %pip install -r dev/requirements.txt
```

## Authenticate on Codespaces or Colab

To authenticate with Severless run, and go to the link provided to authenticate your CLI.

```{python}
!unionai create login device-flow
```

To make sure everything is working, run this sample workflow:

```{python}
!unionai run --remote workflows/starter.py main
```

Go to the link provided to see your execution on Union!

## ML Workflow

In this section, we will launch a simple ML workflow and get familiar with the Python SDK, `flytekit`. If you are on Codespaces, you can see the `workflows/ml_workflow.py` in the IDE. On Colab, please go [to this link](https://github.com/thomasjpfan/unionai-llm-tracking-workshop/blob/main/workflows/ml_workflow.py) to see the code.

One benefit of `flytekit` is that you can run the workflow locally as well:

```{python}
!unionai run workflows/ml_workflow.py main
```

And to run the workflow on Union:

```{python}
!unionai run --remote workflows/ml_workflow.py main
```

In this section, we highlight the following features in the SDK and UI:

- `@task`, `@workflow` in SDK
- `ImageSpec`
- Declarative infrastructure
- Caching
- `FlyteDeck`
- Task level metrics

## LLM Workflow

In this section, we run a LLM workflow using Hugging Face and Weights and Biases. If you are on Codespaces, you can see the `workflows/llm_tracking.py` in the IDE. On Colab, please go [to this link](https://github.com/thomasjpfan/unionai-llm-tracking-workshop/blob/main/workflows/llm_tracking.py) to see the code.

First, please go to [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize) to log into your Weights and Biases account and get an API key.

Run the following command to create a secret on Union and paste n your wandb API key:

```{python}
!unionai create secret wandb_api_key
```

To see all your secrets run:

```{python}
!unionai get secret
```

With the secret define, you can now run:

```{python}
!unionai run --remote workflows/llm_tracking.py main \
    --wandb_project unionai-serverless-demo \
    --model distilbert-base-uncased
```

Models you can use are:
- `bert-base-cased`
- `distilbert-base-uncased`
- `roberta-base`

In this section, we highlight the following code and UI features:

- Secrets API
- UI to trigger workflow
- TLM for GPUs
- Error handling

## VSCode Integration

In this section, we will launch a VSCode instance hosted by Union to interact with the LLM trained by the previous workflow. To get the URI for our model, copy and paste the execution id into the following cell:

```{python}
from unionai.remote import UnionRemote

EXECUTION_ID = "..."

remote = UnionRemote()
execution = remote.fetch_execution(name=EXECUTION_ID)
llm_uri = execution.outputs["o1"].remote_source

print(llm_uri)
```


Lastly, we launch the vscode environment by running:

```{python}
!unionai run --remote workflows/launch_vscode.py main --model $llm_uri
```

We will highlight how to get the model in Union's VSCode enviornment and how to use Jupyter to interact query the model.
